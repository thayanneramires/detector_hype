            http3:

                If set to `True`, Impit will try to connect to the target servers using HTTP/3 protocol (if supported by the server).

                .. note::
                    The HTTP/3 support is experimental and may not work with all servers. The impersonation capabilities are limited when using HTTP/3.

            proxy:

                The proxy URL to use for all the requests made by this client.

                This can be an HTTP, HTTPS, or SOCKS proxy.
            timeout:
                Default request timeout in seconds.

                This value can be overridden for individual requests.
            verify:
                If set to `False`, impit will not verify SSL certificates.

                This can be used to ignore TLS errors (e.g., self-signed certificates).

                True by default.
            default_encoding:
                Default encoding for response.text field (e.g., "utf-8", "cp1252").

                Overrides `content-type` headers and bytestream prescan.
            follow_redirects:

                If set to `True` the client will automatically follow HTTP redirects (3xx responses).

                `False` by default.
            max_redirects:

                Maximum number of redirects to follow if the `follow_redirects` option is enabled.

                Default is 20.
            cookie_jar:

                Cookie jar to store cookies in.

                This is a `http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance.

                By default, :class:`Client` doesn't store cookies between requests.
            cookies: httpx-compatible cookies object.

                These are the cookies to include in all requests (to the matching servers) made by this client.
            headers: Default HTTP headers to include in requests.

                These headers will be included in all requests made by this client.

                Default is an empty dictionary.
            local_address:

                Local address to bind the client to.

                Useful for testing purposes or when you want to bind the client to a specific network interface.
                Can be an IP address in the format `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` (for IPv4) or `ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff` (for IPv6).
